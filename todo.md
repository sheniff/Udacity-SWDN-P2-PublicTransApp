# ToDo

* [x] Cache and serve departure times
* [x] Fetch departures times even when there's serving cached ones (we need both)
* [x] Store timestamp when the last data cache happened to discount times accordingly in case of refresh
* [x] Countdown minutes automatically to pretend time's ticking even without connection
* [ ] Add connectivity checks (to know when we're offline or online to fetch data again)
* [ ] Show a message stating there's no connection at that moment
